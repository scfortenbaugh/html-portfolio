<h1>Shawnda's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>My top 6 movies of all time!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Departed</h3>
<p>Hello??? Mark Wahlberg!!! But really, such a stellar cast of actors and a great storyline that involves one of my most favorite gangsters, Whitey Bulger!</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>The element of surprise at the end had me wondering what in the world I just watched. It took a second watch for me to really understand the movie.</p>

<h3>Ocean's 11</h3>
<p>Same as Fight Club. I love movies that have the twist at the very end and turns your understanding of the movie upside down.</p>

<h3>Smokin' Aces</h3>
<p>Now this movie is a favorite because it kept my attention from start to finish with the cinematics.</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Such an incredible mind-bending movie. You have to watch this movie more than twice to even BEGIN to understand it.</p>

<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>As with Smokin' Aces, there were so many elements of cinematic masterpieces from objects dancing in the background to words on the screen moving along with music. Small details like that make so many great movies into incredible movies just because those things keep me glued to the movi to see what I can spot next.</p>
